# Sales-Effectiveness
In this project, I built a machine learning model to improve lead categorization for FicZon Inc., helping prioritize high-potential leads. 
I used Decision Trees and Random Forests to automate the process, reducing manual effort and improving conversion rates.
My role involved data cleaning, analysis, model building, and ensuring smooth deployment into the business workflow. 
This project strengthened my skills in predictive modeling and real-world problem-solving.
